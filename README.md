# techNotes
Manage notes mainly about technologies

## Policy
I cannot understand and remember at once.
Do not get frustrated.
Take time and check notes until you no longer necessary.

## Rules
### Git
- Unnecessary to create a branch
- Make commit after each update
- Push periodically
- Manage ToDo in Trello not issue in GitHub

Commit Prefixes
- "Add": make new note
- "Update": Addition to the note
- "Fix": Fix error
- "Clean": Refactor the note
- "Finish": Finish reading the book and add the date

Commit message will look like
`{Prefix} {File_name} {abstract of commit details}`

### Note Format
Note format for books
```md
# Book Title
Author1, Author2, & Author3. Publisher, YYYY.MM.DD.

Finish reading at: YYYY.MM.DD

###### Purpose
